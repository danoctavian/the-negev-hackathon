no one wanted to believe... believe it even existed. And when the truth finally dawned, it dawned in CODE.

## SPEC

The spec is under work and any suggestions of how to make it better are very welcome and appreciated.

### Schedule 

6:00 PM 14 aug 2015 - 7:00 PM 15 aug 2015

 14 august 2015

  * 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM  pre-hackathon social

  * 7:00 PM - 7:20 PM  start talk

 15 august 2015

  * 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM pitches

We aim to allow 2.5 minutes per pitch.

### Location

The Negev 6th street first floor and basement. We estimated the seated capacity of this space at roughly 50 people.

### Invites

We intend to open the hackathon to Negev 6th people and friends of Negev. (same rules that apply to Negev 6th party invites). We will cap the number of participants at 50 and give spots on a first-come first-served basis.

### Theme

This is very much up for debate. Please come with creative suggestions!

Proposed themes:

*  **\#quadlife** - build something that improves life in Negev-scale communities

 ![alt text](https://github.com/danoctavian/the-negev-hackathon/blob/master/pics/russian-dormitory.jpg "the great bear watches over you. always.")

* **I want to know what love is** - build something that helps a bunch of guys and gals get more action

 ![alt text](https://github.com/danoctavian/the-negev-hackathon/blob/master/pics/watch-out-for-buttsex.jpg "...")

* **fitspo** - build something that keeps our asses firm in spite of Chicos pizza. fitness/health theme

 ![alt text](https://github.com/danoctavian/the-negev-hackathon/blob/master/pics/tight-ass.gif "nnnnnggggggg")

* **Linux motherfuckers** - Linux sucks? Ok, challenge to all mac lovers and creatives to build something that makes it more usable by humans.

 ![alt text](https://github.com/danoctavian/the-negev-hackathon/blob/master/pics/linus-jobs.png "Torvalds is the one true God.")

* **freestyle** - just do whatever the fuck you want.


### Food

Traditionally hackathons have pizza and coke as food/drink.

I would like instead something that is reasonably priced while being healthier to eat.

Other proposals:

* Chicken with smth smth (Rosa, what was that again?)

* Snack platters

If you have any good suggestions of how to spend a buget of roughly 6$ a person on food we're all ears.

### Judges

We are currently working on getting some reputable people on our board of judges. Aiming to have 3 people on the board.

If you think your CEO/CTO is willing to descend in the Negev basements to meet some awesome hackers and judge their creations, let's talk.

### Prizes!!!

We are currently working on getting company sponsored prizes for the hackathon. Stay tuned and please lend a hand if you think the company you own/work for would be willing to help us here!

The top prize is accompanied by a check of 100 trillion zimbabwe dollars and maybe your mugs on it.

Last but not least, the coveted and elusive Bret Foxx award. This prize is reserved for an exceptional feat of hacking that will be talked about for many Negev generations to come. No one knows if anyone worthy of this prize will rise during the hackathon...
