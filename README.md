## SPEC

### Schedule 

6:00 PM 14 aug 2015 - 7:00 PM 15 aug 2015

 14 august 2015

  * 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM  pre-hackathon social

 15 august 2015

  * 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM pitches

### Location

The Negev 6th street first floor and basement. We estimated the seated capacity of this space at roughly 50 poeple.

### Theme

This is very much up for debate. Please come with creative suggestions!

Proposed themes:

*  **\#quadlife** - build something that improves life in Negev-scale communities

 ![alt text](https://github.com/danoctavian/the-negev-hackathon/blob/master/pics/russian-dormitory.jpg "the great bear watches over you. always.")

* **I want to know what love is** - build something that helps a bunch of guys and gals get more action

* **fitspo** - build something that keeps our asses firm in spite of Chicos pizza. fitness/health theme

* **Linux motherfuckers** - Linux sucks? Ok, challenge to all mac lovers and creatives to build something that makes it more usable by humans.

* **freestyle** - just do whatever the fuck you want.


### Food

Traditionally hackathons have pizza and coke as food/drink.

I would like instead something that is reasonably priced while being healthier to eat.

Other proposals:

* Chicken with smth smth (Rosa, what was that again?)

* Snack platters

### Judges

We are currently working on getting some reputable people on our board of judges. Aiming to have 3 people on the board.

If you think your CEO/CTO is willing to descend in the Negev basements to meet some awesome hackers and judge their creations, let's talk.

### Prizes!!!

We are currently working on getting company sponsored prizes for the hackathon. Stay tuned and please lend a hand if you think the company you own/work for would be willing to help us here!

Last but not least, the coveted and elusive Bret Foxx award. This prize is reserved for an exceptional feat of hacking that will be talked about for many Negev generations to come.
